            <p> The Porsche 930 is the internal designation for the turbocharged variant of the 911 model manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche between 1975 and 1989. </p>
            <p>It was the maker's top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the time of its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany</p>

            <p> The 930 proved very fast but also very demanding to drive, and due to its short wheelbase and rear engine layout, was prone to oversteer and turbo-lag. </p>
            <p>It acquired the nickname "the Widowmaker" after several crashes and deaths attributed to its handling characteristics, which were unfamiliar to many drivers. </p>
